# Contributing to ContainerSSH

Welcome! And a big thank you for wanting to contribute!

Let's get you started. First of all, this project is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md). This means that the
code you submit will be usable for anyone for any purpose free of charge. Please submit code that you personally own
or have permission to submit under this license, and only if you are ok with that.

That's out of the way, let's focus on making your contribution happen. ContainerSSH is written in
[go](https://golang.org/). Love it or hate it, it's one of the simplest way to create a single binary you can package
into a container and it happens to have an excellent SSH library, which is somewhat of a rarity. If you want to
contribute you will have to do so in Go. If you are not familiar with it you might want to take
[Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) for a spin.

If you have Go somewhat in your grasp I would recommend installing either [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
[Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) as having an IDE with code completion will help you with navigating around the
code. I personally use Goland, but it's not free so VSCode may be the way to go for you.

For good style you may want to run `make build` to give your code the code style check treatment. It's painless, I
promise.

Finally, before you send in a pull request feel free to
[open an issue to discuss your proposal](https://github.com/janoszen/containerssh/issues/new) if you are uncertain about
it.
